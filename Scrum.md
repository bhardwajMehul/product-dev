# Scrum

The word scrum comes from the sports rugby. Where the players huddle together in an interlocked position pushing against the opponents. Each player has a defined role in their position and can play both offensive and defensive as per the demand of the situation.

Similarly, the scrum in IT believes in empowered self-managed development teams with three specific and clearly defined roles. These roles include – Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM) and the development team consisting of the programmers and testers. They work together in iterative time boxed durations called sprints.

It is 3-3-5 Framework i.e.
3 Roles, 3 Artifacts, and 5 Events
Roles	Artifacts	Events
Product Owner (PO)	Product Backlog	Sprint
Scrum Master (SM)	Sprint Backlog	Sprint Planning
Development Team (DT)	Product Increment	Sprint Review
		Sprint Retrospection
		Daily Scrum

Now let’s understand the sprint, a scrum framework is an agile framework used to develop products. It does not follow the waterfall model, it is a combination of iterative and incremental models. It basically converts the making of product into ‘n’ different parts depending on the product and the team. These are nothing but called sprints. Sprints are basically predefined time intervals in which we do the development of the part which we have divided the sprint for. We now understand how a scrum works.

We first make a team called the Scrum Team which is typically a size of 6-9 persons containing 1 SM, 1 PO and 4-7 Developers, Designers, Testers, Database Administrators, Dev-Ops Engineer or any person needed for building the product.
This team will be the one building a product for a certain customer/stakeholder/company. So, this team should be-
1.	Self-Organizing- 
The team should be self-reliant and self-sufficient in terms of accomplishing the tasks without the need of any external help.
2.	Cross-Function-
The team together should possess the necessary skills to achieve the work given to them. 
Next comes the question that what we’ll be building,
The PO will be first engaging with the customer/stakeholder/company and will all the information about the product that the team will be building in coming weeks. As per the customer/stakeholder/company the PO will then convert the need into very small parts called stories and it should give a basic idea of what this should do. Like, A user moves to “Login page and can login via Email, Phone number”. And then the PO will upload these stories or user stories to the product Backlog.
A Product backlog is a bucket or a wish-list where all the tasks are dumped and the whole team can have the access to read it, but only the PO has the permission to change anything in it.
Here the DT and PO does the brainstorming and prioritize what work should be done first and are given some points. Now according to these points and priority the team then decides what stories should be added to the sprint backlog.
A sprint backlog is again a bucket or a list that the team will be doing in the upcoming sprint. Stories are picked from the product backlog and transferred to the sprint backlog one at a time. This collective list now known as a Sprint Backlog.
 
The addition of stories in sprint backlog is done in Sprint Planning which is of roughly 2 hours (considering 2 weeks sprint). It is the starting point of the sprint. In this the entire scrum team gathers and discusses the
The DT then give the stories a story point.
Story points are just complexity of a user story. Like, consider there is a sprint of 2 weeks.
Points	1	2	3	5	8	13	21
Time	1-2 Hours	Half Day	Full Day	1.5-2 Days	Half week / 3-4 Days	1 Week	2 Weeks

If we see, then the points are in Fibonacci series. These points are given with the reference with the given time to the respective user story and each and every member of the DT gives the points and at last the work is assigned to the members of the DT. The work is assigned by the PO and in a manner that no one on in the is sitting idle or is overburdened.
After everyone is assigned with the work in the team, the team begins to develop the tasks given to them and build it as a product at the end of a sprint. Meanwhile in a sprint the SM gathers everyone everyday (leaving the day of planning, review and retrospection) for a daily sprint or stand-up for not more than 15 minutes, where the PO asks everyone 3 question-
1)	What have you done yesterday?
2)	What you will be doing today?
3)	Any problems or issues you are facing?
Here the SM is the one who initiates the meeting, gathers everyone and follows up with everyone for their problems and at the ending those problems for them.
After the everyday meetings there is conducted a sprint review or review meeting at the end of the sprint cycle, where the team demonstrates the PO with demo and then the PO verifies it and passes it. If something went wrong, then PO asks then the PO asks what went wrong and how are we going to overcome the lag.
And at last comes the sprint retrospection or retrospection meeting which is conducted after the review meeting where the whole Steam discusses-
1)	What went well during the sprint?
2)	What went wrong during the sprint?
3)	Lessons learnt from this sprint?
4)	What actions to take to overcome the lag in the sprint?
Now let’s take an example, 
Let say we have a team of 6 people where 1 is SM, 1 is PO and 4 are in DT.
Everyone everyday works for about 8 hours and sprint is of 2 weeks. Removing holidays, a sprint now has 10 working days, so everyone in a DT will be working for 80 hours and team combined will be working for 320 hours. If we convert points for the respective working hours, then a person will have a point of 21, and the whole team’s points would be 84.
Everyone has now selected the user stories for the sprint backlog and have marked their sprint points for the stories. Now the PO will take some actions to calculate what work should be given to whom so that the total story points for a person should be ideally equal to 21, if it is greater than 21 then the member is overburdened and if it is less, then the member will be sitting idle for some time. After everyone is assigned with the tasks, the team starts working on it. The SM calls everyone for daily sprints, review meetings and retrospection. If everything goes well, then the module is kept for merging, else if it is not working as planned like if a member is facing difficulty while developing or testing something then the PO assigns some additional help to the member form the team only. And this way a sprint is completed.


Now some points to note.
Roles of a SM-
a)	The SM should act as a coach for both DT and PO. That person should establish a proper communication between PO and DT, keep off any obstacle coming between PO and DT, and keep the Steam motivated.
b)	The SM should provide everything the DT or PO has requested and which can increase the productivity of the team while remaining in the boundaries of the company rules.
c)	The SM should behave as a safe keeper for the Steam. The SM should keep away all the distractions or roadblocks from the team or anything else which can decrease the productivity of the team.
Roles of a PO-
a)	The PO is a bridge between if the DT and the company/stakeholder/customer. The PO takes the responsibilities of every decision taken and building the right product. The PO has all the rights to enter and delete anything from the product backlog. 
b)	The PO is the one who will be passing the product according to his/her acceptance rules made with or without the help of DT.
c)	The PO works closely with the DT and can also be part of the DT. He/she should give help any help to the team that a PO can give.
Roles of DT-
a)	It is the DT’s work to build a functionality with no bugs and completely tested with the parameters in the sprint time or boundary.
b)	DT is responsible for providing the correct sprint points to the user story and giving priority to the user stories in the product backlog.
Ideal Product Backlog should be-
a)	Prioritized- The stories in this backlog should be properly prioritized and the factors could be anything and this selection is made by combined efforts of DT and PO. It just helps the team to understand what needs to be delivered first.
b)	Estimated- The stories should be properly estimated.
c)	High Level- The stories should not be very detailed, it should only tell what to do and the team can understand what has to be done, that’s it.
d)	Dynamic- This backlog should be dynamic as there can be changes made in future as there are issues from both the DT and customer/stakeholder/company.
